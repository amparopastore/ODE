# Predicting Future Behavior of a System: Euler's Method, R2K, etc

The purpose of this notebook is to explore various computer assisted methods to predict the future behavior of a system from a knowledge of its dynamics.
This knowledge consists of a set of differential equations that relate the rate of change of the system's quantities to the current state of the system. In particular, I look at the coupled dynamics of two quantities $a$ and $b$ with the differential equation $\frac{da}{dt}=b, \frac{db}{dt}=-a$.
